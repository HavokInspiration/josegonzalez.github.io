  <div class="entry-content">

    <p>I&#39;ve been recently doing a bit of systems administration at SeatGeek, and it strikes me that much of the monitoring/alerting code there sucks for one or more of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ridiculous setup</li>
<li>Costs money</li>
<li>Is a service</li>
<li>Terrible UI</li>
<li>Terrible Codebase</li>
<li>Requires a specific version of a library that I cannot get installed on a machine</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, let me show you them:</p>

<h2>Existing Tools</h2>

<h3>Cacti</h3>

<p>Cacti is cool. It&#39;s supposed to be a real simple way of aggregating statistics about your installations. It uses RRDTool to store data - which is apparently super compressed and efficient at making graphs - with a periodic cron triggered to collect said data. It sucks for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Codebase was written before they discovered programming patterns. Or actual programming. I honest to god don&#39;t know how they continue to fix bugs, it seems so error prone. I think the developers like spaghetti</li>
<li>RRDTool <code>.rrd</code> files must be converted when used on other architectures, like 64-bit =&gt; 32-bit. Or Linux =&gt; Mac. Kind of annoying to debug the code if you have to convert a crap-ton of files to <code>.xml</code> and then back.</li>
<li>No api to automate adding new services/nodes to Cacti. Bringing up a new webserver means re-adding like 30 items to cacti. You&#39;re fucked if this is a new backup machine</li>
<li>Collecting new stats means writing all sorts of XML files. On top of the stats collection. Guess which one is the bigger pain in the ass.</li>
<li>Can no longer easily upgrade from non-plugin architecture to the plugin architecture. Which means I can&#39;t use Thold for alerts.</li>
<li>Plugins are out of date, or unmaintained.</li>
<li>Docs are obtuse.</li>
</ul>

<p>You get the picture. It&#39;s a cool tool, and I totally respect what the folks behind Cacti are doing, but it&#39;s definitely not a tool I want to use going forward.</p>

<h3>Nagios</h3>

<p>Nagios is supposed to be enterprise. Super-duper enterprise. In fact, it&#39;s so enterprise that:</p>

<ul>
<li>There doesn&#39;t seem to be a straightforward way of installing it. Or at least the 90-million &quot;Install Nagios in 10 easy payments of your soul&quot; don&#39;t make it so</li>
<li>Setting up new items to monitor seems... also not-straightforward. Why do you need a DSL for this? Aren&#39;t there UIs/APIs?</li>
<li>They also sell a paid version. Great, now I know the version I have is not as awesome.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d love for someone to prove me wrong, but I have a limited amount of time in the week to implement this stuff.</p>

<h3>Ganglia</h3>

<p>Looks like a glorified Cacti. Without something to grab stats. Woot.</p>

<h3>All Paid Services</h3>

<ul>
<li>I hate paying over nine thousand dollars to get/store useful metrics.</li>
<li>If your service gets bought, then I&#39;m SOL if I cannot pay whatever the new rate will be</li>
<li>Featureset/UI out of my control. Usually not a big deal, except when there is a small bug I can fix in 5 seconds/4 lines of javascript but can&#39;t because I don&#39;t have commit access</li>
<li>If your repository for installing your code goes away, that breaks my chef cookbooks. Awesome.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I&#39;d like</h2>

<p>Ideally the tool is easy to install and doesn&#39;t require a specific version of a language/library. This rules out <code>Python</code>/<code>Ruby</code> tools because they will either be built specifically for Ruby <code>1.8.7</code> or <code>1.9.2</code>, and my machine is not running that. As much as I&#39;d love to use them, they are out simply because of deployment issues.</p>

<p>That leaves PHP.</p>

<p>Preferably not spaghetti PHP. So something built in a framework.</p>

<p>I already have a system for storing data: <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a> and <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/statsd_rb">StatsD</a>. I already have the application tossing data at Graphite, but I also have existing Cacti data. What would be nice is a tool to migrate from an existing set of <code>.rrd</code> files to Graphite. I can back-date data in Graphite, so this should hopefully be straightforward. The data keys can be:</p>

<pre class="rainbow-code"><code data-language="generic">hostname.service_name.metric</code></pre>

<p>Grouping metrics is key. Because Graphite already stores application-related statistics, and also would store stats on a per-instance basis, I would like a way to track different sets of metrics somewhere. Because of how graphs are created, it would be useful to store information about each graph - who created the graph, usecase, a damned name - along with it. This data could change from graph to graph of course.</p>

<p>Whenever I create a graph, it should be easy to share it with others. My boss may want to see how deploys affect conversions, or we may want to place one of these in a blog post about earthquakes. Sharing the url to a graph should be straightforward. It should also be possible for me to save a snapshot of a graph somewhere, although this can be a generic interface that can be extended as time goes on. Please note, we should be able to annotate the hell out of these stored graphs.</p>

<p>Replacing Cacti is a big reason for building this tool, so it would be useful to build a simple interface wherein I can easily collect stats about different instances and shove them into graphite. It&#39;s not easy to figure out what is available for graphing in Cacti, so exploring the Graphite stats tree is an important feature, although not front and center.</p>

<p>Alerts are important. How do we build alerts? You can retrieve raw data from graphite and somehow build some simple trending. Might be too much work for an initial build.</p>

<p>As far as the UI is concerned, <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> is cool. All it needs are some changes to the default color scheme to provide a bit of visual identity. Would be dope to be able to specify a logo so that your boss thinks you built some rad tool.</p>

<p>So I want a system built on top of this. In an MVC framework. CakePHP/Lithium preferred, as that is what I am used to, but so long as it isn&#39;t terrible code, I don&#39;t care. The portions that control graph-creation from graphite should be separate from stats collection. Ideally someone could reimplement the app in their own PHP framework, still using whatever UI/PHP libraries I have with minimal changes.</p>

<p>A recap?</p>

<ul>
<li>PHP-based tool, built in a framework</li>
<li>Graphs should be easy to create, annotate and share. Bonus for embeddable graphs</li>
<li>Must also collect stats about instances

<ul>
<li>Should be generic enough that it would be possible to write a one-liner to collect a new statistic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alerts are useful, but perhaps it would be better to leave alerts elsewhere.</li>
<li>Some attention should be paid to UI. This is 2012, lets make graphing easy on the eyes</li>
<li>Graphing/UI should be fairly generic, and easy to move to another framework as necessary</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some thoughts</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t have any goals for introducing logs into this. Would be nice to be able to overlay a graph onto a series of logs from instances.</p>

<p>Feels like I would be rebuilding tools that exist. Or that the tools I&#39;m comparing this theoretical system to are vastly different.</p>

<p>Alerts are hard. Is there any easy way to do this with Graphite?</p>

<p>Can this be built from existing tools quickly? Does this exist already somewhere?</p>
